# VHDLtree
Use case scenario : you enter in a new project provided with some rtl sources that you didn't code, you say : "fair enough, all i need to know is the interface and some additional documentation. i trust my colleagues' coding skills ;D" ... but then you need to compile and you don't know the design hierarchy tree, and which module calls whatever other module. And so starts this minigame of hierarchy back engineering. Instead you can use this py script to generate the associated hierarchy tree of your rtl folder. Enjoy your new organized design :)
